# Lily58 3D Printing Files  
These are the files pertaining to my Typeractive Lily58's 3D printed parts.

Models Only  
Left: [1.0 mm](https://github.com/xanderru/lily58-3D-printing/blob/main/data/case/lily58_left.stl) | [0.8 mm](https://github.com/xanderru/lily58-3D-printing/blob/main/data/case/lily58_left0.8.stl) | [0.6 mm](https://github.com/xanderru/lily58-3D-printing/blob/main/data/case/lily58_left0.6.stl)  
Right: [1.0 mm](https://github.com/xanderru/lily58-3D-printing/blob/main/data/case/lily58_right.stl) | [0.8 mm](https://github.com/xanderru/lily58-3D-printing/blob/main/data/case/lily58_left0.8.stl) | [0.6 mm](https://github.com/xanderru/lily58-3D-printing/blob/main/data/case/lily58_left0.6.stl)  
  
Notes  
- The tenting feet that are intended to be used for this are ~56mm x ~16mm x 3.5mm from Typeractive. Other keyboard websites sell 3.5 mm feet that look similar, but I can't guarantee that they will fit. Many similarly styled feet are sold on Amazon, but be warned, most of them are much larger than the one intended for this case. Be sure to measure and check fit! 
- There are three different sizes of the left and right models because I made three sets of models each with different depths for the cutouts. I discovered that the tenting feet are not totally flush. The rubber bit in particular extends about 0.2-0.4 mm, so I made versions where the cutouts are slightly deeper if that is what you would prefer. I chose to stick with the 1.0 mm version as it doesn't rock and I like the slight contact of the surface with the rubber as it actually keeps the keyboard from sliding all over the place during usage.  
- The standoffs and top plate are the ones that came stock from Typeractive; however, the M2 bottom plate screws have been replaced to accommodate for the bottom plate changes. I specifically used M2 x 6 mm countersunk screws. 
  
## Keycap Printing Preset

Notes  
- Saddle Tilted keys are printed either thicker side up or thicker side down depending on where they go on your keyboard. This is to minimize contact both visually and physically with the lower quality and rougher first layer.  
- I've not been able to find settings that produce perfect first layers, so I would recommend some post processing. Light sanding should do the trick for the most part and do be sure to dry your filament! If you can print in ABS and do some chemical smoothing or print in resin, even better.
